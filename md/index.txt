# Boycott the MyLboro app

*Continued possession of a working, charged Android or iOS device should **not** be required for study.*

This is not a protest against the process of tracking attendance _per se_, but one against the use
of a smartphone application to monitor it.&ensp;The aim of this protest is to **demand a return to
the use of paper registers for attendance monitoring** through a mass refusal to use the new
system, or at least the adoption of a system which mandates no hardware requirements on students
beyond perhaps our own University-issued ID.

The protest itself is simple: log out from and log in as a guest to, or uninstall, or do not 
install, the myLboro app, and do not register attendance using the myLboro system.&ensp;Your
timetables can be found in-browser [here](https://lucas.lboro.ac.uk/its_apx/f?p=250:LOGIN:8179437730091),
if you need them.&ensp;You do this at your own risk, but it is to your advantage to get as many
people on board with this as possible, and to make the existence of the cause as visible as
possible to passive observers.&ensp;With enough participants, and enough publicity, this will not
be ignorable or suppressible.

## Some reasons for opposition

As with any movement, peoples' motivations are likely to be many and varied.&ensp;Some that come to
mind for me are:

- Contempt for the assumption that a person of our generation must necessarily have a smartphone.
- That it puts pressure not to go without owning an iOS or Android smartphone, as a permanent
  measure or otherwise, whether this be voluntarily or due to damage / loss / theft.&ensp;Voluntary
  cases may include the desire to use a less distracting or longer-battery-life feature-phone, or
  to use a smartphone with a lower-market-share operating system, or to not use a mobile phone.
- That a smartphone will run out of battery during the day, before you can substantially charge it,
  is a constant concern if you're using one.&ensp;This does not improve this situation at
  all.&ensp;And before you say anything, battery saving modes will generally work by limiting
  background activity and limiting internet access when the screen is off, and this will likely
  prevent the app from working in the background.
- The app's click-through licence agreement shown prior to logging in as a student (the same one
  where you sign away your location data) states "If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement
  please do not download, install or use the App and remove it from your device."&ensp;Sure thing.
- Some may abide by a general policy of keeping location services turned off, which will not be
  possible if the app is to function.
- Some may abide by a Stallmanist policy of avoiding non‐FL/OS software whatsoever.&ensp;While I do
  not abide by this lifestyle, I am in support of peoples' rights to do so if they wish.

## Why this manifesto?

If I were to refuse using the app on principle as a lone actor, this would likely have little
effect other than possibly getting myself into trouble.&ensp;I do not, however, perceive the
introduction of this system to be positively viewed by my fellow students.&ensp;With enough
publicly visible adoption, enough public movement, and with the University being visibly proud
of its high ratings for student experience so far, a protest having gained adequate momentum
cannot simply be brushed aside.

## Who am I

I am Thomas Hori (T.H.Hori-16), studying Chemical Engineering at Loughborough
University.&ensp;I got my first smartphone when I was 16½.&ensp;Long before this, staff would
occasionally assume that pupils, including myself and my sister, would have a smartphone e.g. for
taking photographs.&ensp;From this, I acquired a lasting hatred of the expectation that a person of
my generation must necessarily have a working smartphone.

I do presently use one, but one which is presently damaged or defective in multiple ways.&ensp;I do
wish to remain at liberty to, in principle, stop using one.

## Spread the word

I invite and encourage you to do your part in raising the profile and prominance of this cause,
both to potential joiners and to passive observers.&ensp;You are encouraged to, for example, refer
people to this page, or to distribute the following poster:

.. [Poster version #1](/posters/bmlb001.pdf)  
.. [Poster version #2](/posters/bmlb002.pdf)  

[Poster version #3](/posters/bmlb003.pdf)

You should feel by no means limited to what I've come up with in this regard.&ensp;You may feel at
liberty to create your own posters to raise awareness, for example.&ensp;Also, keep checking this
page for further material.
