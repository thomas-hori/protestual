> Developer of a free OCR-A package (originally designed by an ANSI committee) 
> consisting of metafonts and type 1 typefaces found here. He used the OCR-A 
> metafont files of Tor Lillqvist and Richard B. Wales to make large bitmaps, 
> which were use in potrace to make outline traces. FontForge was used to create 
> the fonts. His font exactly matches the X3.17-1977 document of the American 
> National Standards Institute. I [Luc Devroye] found some problems in the 
> truetype file, so I used FontForge to generate OCRA in 2008 in Truetype, 
> Opentype and type 1 formats, leaving the Sauter copyright intact inside the font.

Sauter's readme file: 
https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ocr-a-font/OCR-A/1.0/ReadMe.txt

From that file:

> The OCR-A font was developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
> to be readable by the computers of the 1960s.  The OCR-A font is still used
> commercially in payment advice forms so that a lockbox company can determine 
> the account number and amount owed on a bill when processing a payment.  
> A site license for the OCR-A font is very expensive, so I undertook to create 
> a free font.  I started with the MetaFont definitions, used FontForge and potrace 
> to construct a TrueType font, then assigned each glyph a Unicode code point.  
> I visually compared the resulting character shapes with ANSI X3.17-1977.
> 
> To use the OCRA font with Microsoft Windows, download file OCRA.ttf and drop 
> it in your fonts folder.  To print with it, choose font OCRA and size 10 point.
> 
> The other files in this project will be of interest to those who
> wish to modify the font.  The shape of each glyph was defined by ANSI as
> described in their document ANSI X3.17-1977.  Those shapes were coded
> in the MetaFont language as strokes by Tor Lillqvist and Richard B. Wales.
> Their work is in the .MF files under MetaFont Sources.  The MetaFont program
> and the OCR font definitions are available as part of the TeX package from 
> the CTAN archive.
> 
> I compiled the OCR-A font into a large bitmap to make edge finding easier; 
> that file is ocr10.pk.  I then loaded ocr10.pk into FontForge, which is
> available on SourceForge, as background images.  From FontForge I used
> potrace, also available on SourceForge, to trace outlines around the bitmaps.
> I then assigned a Unicode code point to each glyph.  Mostly they were
> obvious, but Unicode does not make provision for the "alternate glyphs"
> of ANSI X3.17-1977, so I found some reasonable places to put them.
> If Unicode ever adds the "alternate glyphs" of ANSI X3.17-1977 to
> their OCR page, the assignments should be updated.  The resulting file
> is OCRA.sdf, which can be read by FontForge if you want to modify the
> character shapes or change the Unicode code points.
> 
> ANSI specifies a character spacing of between 0.09 and 0.18 inch.
> I chose 0.1 inch, since that seems to be a common spacing.
> 
> FontForge is able to write both PostScript and TrueType font files, 
> so I wrote both.  OCRA.afm, OCRA.pfa and OCRA.pfb are the PostScript
> font files, and OCRA.ttf is the TrueType font file.  Windows users need
> only be concerned with the OCRA.ttf file.  Simply drop it into the fonts
> directory and they can print using the OCR-A font by selecting 10-point
> size.
> 
> The American National Standards Institute makes the X3.17-1977 document
> available on their web site for a modest fee.  I purchased that document
> so I could compare the font I am publishing with the official definition.
> I found an exact match, which speaks well for the efforts of Tor Lillqvist
> and Richard B. Wales, since I made no manual changes in the bitmaps or
> the character shapes constructed by potrace.  I would like to have included
> the X3.17-1977 document in this project, for completeness, but ANSI has
> copyrighted it so I cannot.
> 
> There is an article on Wikipedia about the OCR-A font.

Metafont definitions in question: 
http://anorien.csc.warwick.ac.uk/mirrors/CTAN/help/Catalogue/entries/ocr-a.html

Note that Sauter's process apparently used the metafont to render ANSI 
standard glyphs (presumably plus rendered images of the four Lillqvist-Wales 
original glyphs) which he mechanically traced himself, as opposed to deriving 
his outlines from the metafont.
