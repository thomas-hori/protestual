</h2><p>If I were to refuse using the app on principle as a lone actor, this would likely have little effect other than possibly getting myself into trouble.&ensp;I do not, however, perceive the introduction of this system to be positively viewed by my fellow students.&ensp;With enough publicly visible adoption, enough public movement, and with the University being visibly proud of its high ratings for student experience so far, a protest having gained adequate momentum cannot simply be brushed aside. </p><p>If it be that we must advocate disobedience, then so be it.&ensp;At least we would have stood for something in our lives. </p><h2>Who am I </h2><p>I am Thomas Hori (T.H.Hori-16), studying Chemical Engineering at Loughborough University.&ensp;I got my first smartphone when I was 16&frac12;.&ensp;Long before this, staff would occasionally assume that pupils, including myself and my sister, would have a smartphone e.g. for taking photographs.&ensp;From this, I acquired a lasting hatred of the expectation that a person of my generation must necessarily have a working smartphone. </p><p>I do presently use one, but one which is presently damaged or defective in multiple ways.&ensp;I do wish to remain at liberty to, in principle, stop using one. </p><h2>Spread the word </h2><p><a href="/posters/handins.pdf">You may wish to hand this to lecturers.</a> </p><p>I invite and encourage you to do your part in raising the profile and prominance of this cause, both to potential joiners and to passive observers.&ensp;You are encouraged to, for example, refer people to this page, or to distribute the following poster: </p><p><a href="/posters/bmlb003.pdf">Poster</a> and the same as <a href="/posters/bmlb003_flyer.pdf">multiple smaller handouts</a>. </p><p>You should feel by no means limited to what I&rsquo;ve come up with in this regard.&ensp;You may feel at liberty to create your own posters to raise awareness, for example.&ensp;Also, keep checking this page for further material. </p></div></div></body></html>
